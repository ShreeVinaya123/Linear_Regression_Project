# Linear Regression Project 

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of **Linear Regression** using Python and the **scikit-learn** library.

It predicts **student scores based on the number of hours studied** — a classic and beginner-friendly machine learning example.


# What You’ll Learn
  How to create and prepare a simple dataset using pandas
  How to split data into training and testing sets
  How to train a Linear Regression model

  How to evaluate the model using MSE and R² Score
  How to visualize the results using matplotlib


##  Dataset Used

A small self-created dataset with:
**Independent Variable:** Hours of Study
**Dependent Variable:** Exam Scores

Hours_of_Study | Scores
